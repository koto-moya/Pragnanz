I don't have any grand plans for this blog other than codify the last three years of learning and document the next three years of implementation of that learning.  Admittedly, I am terrible writer,  no hard feelings if you cannot bear to suffer my prose.

I will try to keep the Pragnanz talk to big annoucements only.

Here's to developing in public.
