The last 6 months of my life have spent juggling a dead-end job, grokking computer science, and coming to terms with my own shortcomings.  It has been an enlightening experience to say the least.  As I have come to find out, computers are not as impenetrable as I once thought they were.  My only wish is that I had gotten started earlier.  But, regrets are for those who have accepted their demise as fact therefore I will not dwell on it anymore. The hero heads into the unknown leaving comfort and his past behind.

Now that I've gotten a handle on the basics I'm ready to get started on my first big boy project.  What better place to start than vision.  A system that reifies the universe itself all within the [confines of our skull.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgumsELGgGw) A truly astonishing feat of *search* and *learning*.  

Being back in California renewed my appreciation for the ocean.  I missed it dearly.  I'll never forget standing on West Cliff Drive and listening to a sunbaked man call out every good wave before I even saw a ripple.  He didn't miss, not even once.  Back then I though it was just impressive, but now, I think it can be done with 85(x6) grams of sand and mat-muls.  This is where I'll start, reverse engineer the ability to call out good waves using vision alone.  

I know what you're thinking: "Vision is hard, like really hard".  I'm fairly sober to this although hubris tells me I can do it anyway.  Regardless, someone has already left the [breadcrumbs](https://geohot.github.io/blog/jekyll/update/2023/11/18/imitation-learning.html) for me.  If you're reading this, I'm answering the call. I hope I don't fuck it up.
