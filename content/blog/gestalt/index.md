> "An organized whole that is perceived as more than the sum of its parts."

Gestalt is a forward looking startup architecture.  Too many startups with rich datasets have fallen for the SAAS trap. This has allowed the Corposâ„¢ to engorge themselves on their data, completely destroying any competitive edge the startup may have had.  Of course, the easy rebuttal is to say "but I can access my data and do with it what I wish!" and to that I point you [here](https://companiesmarketcap.com/amazon/cash-on-hand/).  You think you can compete with that? If you answered yes, you better have all your data on-prem.  50 years later, Oracle is really living up to its name.  

I'm making a bet that the startup market will move away from cloud and SAAS, recouping what little edge they had, and return to truly owning their technologies end-to-end. Is this naive? Probably, but the alternative is so terrifying that inaction would be morally abhorrent.  

The winners of the next decade will be determined in large part by the extent to which their data architecture is under their control.  Taking a sober look at inference costs alone will show you that cloud does not work in this new paradigm.  Just look at the energy costs of a GPT query vs a Google query.  It doesn't take a genius to see that energy costs in the US will not drop 10x to accommodate this anytime soon.

Right now, Nvidia is eating everyones lunch and then some.  No one is profitable in the AI space, except for these [guys](https://www.comma.ai/) apparently.  If you want to be caught with your pants down, by all means, continue business as usual.  We'll be here when you need us.
