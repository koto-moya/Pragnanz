> Is there a better description of a cube than its construction?


The delayed arrival of the 21st century caught most by surprise.  Shit, I believed what they told me too.  I thought I dodged a bullet by leaving academia early.  I saw the writing on the wall, Physics was dying and there was no saving it.  Watching my PI grovel to donors told me as much.  

There was another reason I left, something more subtle, a *mors philosophica* that nearly killed me.  I won't go into the sob story in detail except to say that 10^-35 is a rather shallow resolution.  Can't exactly fit god in there.  I wandered for a while, painfully searching for an anchor.  Oddly, I am incredibly grateful for this experience. My expansion inwards has given me gifts I will cherish forever.  

I eventually found that anchor or at least I found the line to it.  It still confuses me why I couldn't see it before.  Taylor series, Fourier transforms, SGD, these concepts were drilled into me and I understood them better than most.  *I could hear the music.*  But I was still stuck.   In my imaginings the material always prevailed as *the* axiom.  My thoughts stopping at that smallest distance, never going past, never seeing beyond the veil.

Being well removed from the physical sciences has allowed me to see more clearly the revolution taking place.  Say what you want about Computer Science, it sure gets to the heart of things-far better than Physics ever could.  To be more generous, Physics walked so Information Theory could run.

Any successful agent requires a model of the world that maximizes their [fitness payoffs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_D._Hoffman#:~:text=open%20to%20question.-,Implications%20from%20evolution,fitness%2C%20and%20not%20of%20reality.).  Notice how this says nothing of the content of the *real world* and everything about how the agent represents said content.

The models we are creating today are still just portals into *our* maps.  The real breakthroughs will come when these models open portals *outside* of our maps. What will they look like?  Is it even possible? Given it is possible, will we be able to contextualize it? [Langlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langlands_program) tells us yes.

The DLCs are coming, are you ready to play?
