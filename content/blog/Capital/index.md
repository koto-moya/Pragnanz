# Capital

10 years, $400 million in funding at a $10 billion valuation, and a charismatic leader.  Sound [familiar](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Theranos)?  Once I realized that the collection and mobilization of capital rests on your ability to convince others to give it to you I knew I had no chance of competing in that arena.  The market is like a street fight, whoever is willing to do the [most damage in the shortest amount of time wins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvN0YbcPw_A).  If you have a high capacity for deception you will win more capital, it's really that simple.  

Whatever that quality is, I don't have it.  I am tormented by the judgements of people not even born yet.  Don't get me wrong, I lie, but nowhere near the scale needed to amasse capital.  So, this leaves me with two options: 

1. Continue to work my salary job and make a consistent amount of money for the rest of my life ([yippee](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/purchasing-power-of-the-u-s-dollar-over-time/)).
2. Build something that has real value, distribute it, and reap some of that value for myself.  

The second option seems much more enticing, let's go with that.  To be clear, I do not want to be a billionaire.  All I want is the ability to not worry about money so I can work on things that [matter](/blog/Replicator).  This option relies on accelerating effect of consistent effort over time; don't get it twisted, this will be a decade long effort.  If you'll join me for it I would love to have you.  

Obviously, this process will be gradual.  Creating the LLC was a good first step, Now on to securing my first contract...
