# Capital

10 years, $400 million in funding at a $10 billion valuation, and a charismatic leader.  Sound [familiar](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Theranos)? The extent to which one can amass capital is dependent on ones ability to extract it from others.  The market is like a street fight, whoever is willing to go the [furthest in the shortest amount of time wins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvN0YbcPw_A).  High capacity for deception = more capital, it's really that simple.  

Of course, the true masters of this game will deny these allegations, as we would expect them too.  I used to think this was a bad thing, now I see that the deceivers betray their own intentions with every breath.  You see, the problem with lying is one must believe their own lies in order to convince others

Whatever that quality is, I don't have it.  I am tormented by the judgments of people not even born yet.  Don't get me wrong, I lie, but nowhere near the scale needed to amass Theranos levels of capital.  So, this leaves me with two options: 

1. Continue to work my salary job and make a consistent amount of money for the rest of my life ([yippee](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/purchasing-power-of-the-u-s-dollar-over-time/)).
2. Build something that has real value, distribute it, and reap some of that value for myself.  

At the risk of stating the obvious, I've decided to go with option two. Consistent effort over time; don't get it twisted, this will be a decade long effort.  If you'll join me for it I'd love to have you.  

I don't expect this to make me rich in the traditional sense of the word, rather I expect to gain [real skills](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-v8pD0d5Bmk).
