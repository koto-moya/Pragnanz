# Capital

10 years, $400 million in funding at a $10 billion valuation, and a charismatic leader.  Sound [familiar](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Theranos)? The extent to which you can amass capital is dependent on ones ability to extract it from others.  The market is like a street fight, whoever is willing to go the [furthest in the shortest amount of time wins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvN0YbcPw_A).  High capacity for deception = more capital, it's really that simple.  

Whatever that quality is, I don't have it.  I am tormented by the judgements of people not even born yet.  Don't get me wrong, I lie, but nowhere near the scale needed to amasse capital.  So, this leaves me with two options: 

1. Continue to work my salary job and make a consistent amount of money for the rest of my life [yippee](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/purchasing-power-of-the-u-s-dollar-over-time/).
2. Build something that has real value, distribute it, and reap some of that value for myself.  

The second option seems much more enticing, let's go with that. I just want work on the things that [matter](/blog/Replicator).  Consistent effort over time; don't get it twisted, this will be a decade long effort.  If you'll join me for it I would love to have you.
